## 📱 What is LineVision?

LineVision gives you live crowd information for bars using AI-powered people detection. Cameras installed with bar owner permission stream line images to our secure server. Your app fetches the latest line photo and an estimate of how many people are waiting.

### 🔹 A bar I go to isn’t listed. Why?
LineVision only works with participating venues that allow camera installation. More bars are coming soon!

### 🔹 The live image is missing or outdated.
